# fitness_app
Repository for HCI c/w project/

This project was undertaken by myself (Sean Tierney) and a fellow student Benas Jonyas. I took responsibility for the implementation of the software and Benas undertook the initial design of the software before iteration/refinement as well as the evaluation and the reporting of the project.

This repository stores the assets for a simple web application produced for a project in the Human Computer Interaction course of UoG for the session of 2018-2019. 

This project was done over two days and is based on the assets produced during my summer internship at DTS. The aim of the project was to produce a prototype application that promotes 'fitness' in an 'interesting' manner. 

The conclusions of this project are detailed in the report document.
